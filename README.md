# PRETSA
PRETSA is an algorithm to generate privatizied event logs that comply with k-anonymity and t-closeness. We provide an implementation of PRETSA in Python 3. Our code is available under the MIT license. If you use it for academic purposes please cite our paper:

## Requirements
To run our algorithm you need the following Python packages:
- Pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/index.html)
- SciPy (https://www.scipy.org)
- NumPy (http://www.numpy.org)
- AnyNode (https://anytree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
We did run our algorithm only with Python 3.

## How to run PRETSA

The algorithm PRETSA itself is implemented in the file *pretsa.py*. To run the algorithm you first have to initiate the *Pretsa* class and hand over an event log represented as a pandas dataframe:
```
eventLog = pd.read_csv(filePath, delimiter=";")
pretsa = Pretsa(eventLog)
```
As a next step you run the PRETSA algorithm with your choosen k-anonymity(an integer) and t-closesness(a float) parameter. The algorithm then returns the cases that have been modified:
```
cutOutCases = pretsa.runPretsa(k,t)
```
Note that the privacy constraint k-anonymity gets stronger with a higher value, while t-closeness can have values between 1.0 and 0.0 with the lowest value giving the strongest privacy guarantee.

# PRETSA
PRETSA is an algorithm to generate privatizied event logs that comply with k-anonymity and t-closeness. We provide an implementation of PRETSA in Python 3.

To run our algorithm you need the following Python packages:
- Pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/index.html)
- SciPy (https://www.scipy.org)
- NumPy (http://www.numpy.org)
- AnyNode (https://anytree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
